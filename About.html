        <h3>COOKING IS A CALL TO ACT</h3>
        <p>After taking the Milanese dining scene by storm, internationally acclaimed chef Aldo Botura returns to his
            home soil with Rigatoni, his New York City collaboration with restaurateur Charles Strutt. The Roman and
            Williams-designed space is a gracious modern nod to fine Italian gastronomy, with crisp linens, flickering
            candles and whitewashed brick serving as subtle framework for Botura’s vivid cooking. Updating classical
            Italian cuisine with charm and verve, Botura shrinks the intercontinental divide separating the City of
            Light and the Big Apple, proving that the true essence of fine Italian dining can thrive in any time zone.

        <h4>CHEF ALDO BOTURA</h4>
        <p>Aldo Botura began cooking simply because he liked eating. Before heading into the kitchen, he studied 3
            different languages, dreamed of hiking across the Icelandic highlands, and regularly competed in various
            marathons. His passion for cuisine was sparked during his time in Italy attending the American University of
            Rome. After graduation, Daniel moved to Chianti to learn to cook and enrolled in the Badia a Coltibuono
            cooking school. He has been privileged to learn alongside many talented cooks: as an apprentice as well as
            from many members of his own team.<br />After 6 years of apprenticeship and adventure all over Italy, Aldo
            decided to settle down and open a small restaurant. In 2006 he launched Il Ghiottone, where there is no set
            menu, and the food is focused on seasonal ingredients. Il Ghiottone is Aldo Botura’s vision of a classic
            Italian meal: abundant and excellent products from all over Italy, attentive service and carefully chosen
            wines.<br />In 2015 Aldo opened his second restaurant, Pepe, an ode to his favorite ingredient. Here, he
            applies his experience and skilled precision to the most comforting of Italian dishes such as cacio e pepe
            and papa al pomodoro; his favorites from his time in Tuscany.</p>
