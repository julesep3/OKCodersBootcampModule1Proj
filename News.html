            <p>"<i> The 24-month-old cheese is made into a hot soufflé, the 30-month-old cheese is made into a warm
                    sauce, the 36-month-old cheese is made into a chilled foam, the 40-month-old cheese is made into a
                    crisp, and the 50-month-old cheese is transformed into a light foam that the kitchen staff calls an
                    “air.” By exploring the fundamentals of how the cheese behaves, Bottura created a dish as dynamic as
                    it is delicious.</i>"</emp>

                    of the Lasagna,” which may amount to the most sophisticated manifestation of chips-and-dip ever
